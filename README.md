# Fill-in-the-blanks Questions

## Installation

1. Simply drop this into your WordPress __plugins__ folder
2. Activate the plugin from within WordPress

## What does it do?

It adds a new question type to your e-learning website that requires users to fill in the blanks. Blanks can be created easily by enter shortcodes into the WYSIWYG editor, like so:

	The sky is [question_blank correct="blue"]

### Why?

The [Train-Up!](https://github.com/amk221/train-up) e-learning plugin for WordPress adds a training section to any WordPress website.

The plugin itself comes with Multiple Choice and Single-answer questions built-in. Other question types such as this one can be added on separately.
